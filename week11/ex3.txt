The first program outputs "Hello" and a new line two times because of line buffering.
After forking, each process is given a copy of the data including the buffer that is not flushed yet
Once each fork prints the new line, they both flush their buffer to the stdout stream.

The second program outputs the string "Hello" with two empty lines after it
because the first printf call was flushed to the screen before forking as it had a '\n' in it.
And then, both forks simply print another new line.
