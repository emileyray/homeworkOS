Avoidance is a strategy to avoid a deadlock done with Banker’s Algorithm.
A process is killed with the use of recovery.
Prevention prevents a deadlock by excluding any of the following conditions: 
mutual exculsion, hold an wait, no preemption, circular wait.

In Deadlock avoidance we have to anticipate deadlock before it really occurs and ensure
that the system does not go in unsafe state.It is possible to avoid deadlock if resources
are allocated carefully. For deadlock avoidance we use Banker’s and Safety algorithm for
resource allocation purpose. In deadlock avoidance the maximum number of resources of each
type that will be needed are stated at the beginning of the process.
Deadlock prevention is more strict that Deadlock Avoidance.
