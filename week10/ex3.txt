660 775 and 777 are all on octal form 
and the first digit stands for filw owner permissions,
the second one stands for group owner permisions,
and the last one stands for all other users premissions.

Each digit is translated into binary form and then into permissions:
0 -> 000 -> --- 
1 -> 001 -> --x
2 -> 010 -> -w-
3 -> 011 -> -wx
4 -> 100 -> r--
5 -> 101 -> r-x
6 -> 110 -> rw-
7 -> 111 -> rwx

where r - read, w - write, and x - execute, so

1. 660 means 
6 -> 110 -> rw- -> reading and wriring permissions for user
6 -> 110 -> rw- -> reading and writing permissions for group
0 -> 000 -> --- -> no permission for others

2. 775 means
7 -> 111 -> rwx -> all permissions for user
7 -> 111 -> rwx -> all permissions for group
5 -> 101 -> r-x -> reading and executing permissions for others

3. 777 means
7 -> 111 -> rwx -> all permissions for user
7 -> 111 -> rwx -> all permissions for group
7 -> 111 -> rwx -> all permissions for others
